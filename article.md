## File Loading

### Objective

1. User is able to add a file through click (an enhanced select) or though drag and drop. There's only one component which deals with both of these capabilities (if the user clicks the drop area the select dialog appears, otherwise the user is able to just drop a file over there).

2. The user is able to get some important information about the file: some 'raw' metadata as well as a thumbnail in case of an image or even a video

3. As we're aiming media in this demo, the user must be able to reproduce what he just sent to the browser (i.e, playback).
